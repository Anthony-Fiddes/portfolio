	  I'm an aspiring software engineer with a passion for figuring out how to 
    create simple, elegant code! My current weapon of choice is Go, but I also 
    enjoy working in Python or whatever the project demands!

  <h1>Education</h1>
  <h2>Emory University - 3.87 GPA</h2>
  <h3>Graduating May 2022</h2>
  <p>
	  I am pursuing a BS in Computer Science at Emory University. My coursework 
    has primarily involved learning data structures and algorithms in Java and 
    their underlying math and theory. They have also briefly addressed Assembly 
    and C.
  </p>
  <h2>Relevant Coursework</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>CS170 - Introduction to Computer Science I</li>
    <li>CS171 - Introduction to Computer Science II</li>
    <li>CS224 - Foundations of Computer Science (Discrete math)</li>
    <li>CS253 - Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
    <li>CS255 - Computer Architecture and Machine Level Programming</li>
    <li>MATH 111 - Calculus I</li>
    <li>MATH 112 - Calculus II</li>
    <li>MATH 221 - Linear Algebra</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I use my extra credits to study humanities like Spanish, Linguistics, 
    Sociology, and Psychology.
  </p>
  <h1>Projects</h1>
  <h2>Fare-Comparison</h2>
  <p>
    Fare Comparison is an AppEngine application that I contributed to while working in a team of three developers during
    Google’s 2018 Computer Science Summer Institute in Atlanta. It served as a way to quickly and easily compare Lyft and
    Uber prices for a given ride. It utilized Google APIs to implement location autocomplete, and to return a map of the
    fastest route between the inputted source and destination locations. Python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript were all integral
    tools.
  </p>
  <p>
	  Unfortunately, as a result of a change in Lyft and Uber’s API policies, Fare Comparison no longer functions as intended.
  </p>
  <h1>Coming Soon</h1>
  <h2>Attention</h2>
  <p>
    A group of Go command line tools designed to help users with ADHD to measure and manage their symptoms. This project
    will be heavily inspired by peer-reviewed literature. It will include tools for measuring distractibility, maintaining
    focus on a particular task, and ordering tasks by priority.
  </p>
  <p>
    The name is subject to change to become more interesting.

  <h1>Fun Stuff</h1>
  <p>
    You made it all the way to the bottom of my portfolio! Here are some things I probably wouldn’t include on a regular
    resume!
    <ul>
      <li>At my Google internship in Chicago, I learned how to juggle</li>
      <li>I enjoy playing DnD, particularly homebrew versions</li>
      <li>I have a significant interest in personal finance (budgeting, credit, retirement) and love to share what I know with the people around me when they ask</li>
      <li>My mom is Jamaican, so I can understand a bit of our national language, Patois</li>
      <li>I learned a lot of the sounds of Spanish growing up in North Miami Beach, but I couldn’t roll my r’s until I was 18! It took months of daily practice</li>
      <li>I’ve been doing problems on Project Euler since I was 14, but I only completed my first problem with a difficulty higher than 5% at 19! To be fair, I wasn’t particularly dedicated</li>
      <li>He tomado cinco clases de español en mi universidad. Mi español no está en el nivel de un nativo, ¡pero es bastante bueno para mi!</li>
      <li>I earned the small scar I have on my face in a battle over a blankie I had when I was 5</li>
    </ul>
