    I'm an aspiring software engineer with a passion for figuring out how
    to create simple, elegant code! My current weapon of choice is Go, but
    I also enjoy working in Python.

    I'm pursuing a BS in Computer Science at Emory University. I use my
    extra credits to study humanities like Spanish, Sociology, and Psychology.
